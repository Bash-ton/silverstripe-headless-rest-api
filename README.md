# Silverstripe CMS Headless rest api

This module adds a customizable rest api to Silverstripe for usage with front end frameworks such as Nuxt or Next JS. It adds three end points for fetching navigation and other common fields, site tree and url specific fields.

## Requirements

* SilverStripe ^4.0

## Installation
Add the following section to your composer.json
```json
    "repositories": [
        {

            "url": "https://github.com/olivernorden-silverstripe/silverstripe-headless-rest-api"
        }
    ],

```

composer require olivernorden/silverstripe-headless-rest
```

**Note:** When you have completed your module, submit it to Packagist or add it as a VCS repository to your
project's composer.json, pointing to the private repository URL.
    
## Default api end points
1. `/headless-api/v1/url/<url>` will return all fields pertaining to <url>.
1. `/headless-api/v1/common` will return all fields pertaining to navigation and other common fields.
1. `/headless-api/v1/sitetree` will return all pages with their fields.

## Adding more fields to api
You can add more fields to any of the api end points.
